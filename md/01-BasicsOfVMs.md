# OpenStack software

.container[.col66[

* CSC‚Äôs cPouta/ePouta cloud services are powered by OpenStack.
  * Current OpenStack version used by Pouta services is Queens
* OpenStack is a cloud software that allows end user to create  and use their VM instances, networks and storage.
* Virtualization is a technology that allows the creation of virtual computer resources such as CPU, storage, network, etc.
* Fast moving open source project with backing from industrial giants like: AT&T, Red Hat, IBM, Intel, HP etc.
* Flexible architecture which may support different types of scales.
* Used by many organizations from research institutes to service/content providers.
* Large customer base augments better availability of expertise, support and chances of continuity.
* Supports Web UI, CLI and REST Interfaces

# cPouta ‚òÅÔ∏è

* General purpose service.
* Serving cloud computing needs of Finnish research institutes and universities since 2013.
* VMs and Control plane can be accessed via **public** internet.
* Customers may decide access to VMs by creating firewall rules at OpenStack level known as ‚ÄúSecurity Groups‚Äù.
* Could be used for hosting:
  * Custom services such as Web servers, File servers, load balancer etc.,
  * Scientific applications,
  * Course computer resources for students,
  * Research Data Sharing etc.

# ePouta ‚òÅÔ∏èüîí

* **Sensitive Data** related services.
* Complete Isolation of VMs from rest of the world and other ePouta customers.
  * A (virtual) **private** data center.
* VMs accessible only from customer network.
* Virtual **Private** Cloud: Optical Private Network (OPN) or MPLS[1].footnote[[1] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching>] VPN connection between the end customer and ePouta VM instances.
* Could be used for hosting:
  * Scientific applications dealing with **sensitive data**,
  * **Sensitive Data** Sharing, Archiving etc.
