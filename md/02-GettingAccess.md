# CSC account

.container[.col60[

In order to access Pouta, you first need a CSC account. There are two ways to create an account:

* [Getting an account with Haka or Virtu](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/#getting-an-account-without-haka-or-virtu). If your home organization is a member of the Haka or Virtu federation, you can create an account yourself.

* [Getting an account without Haka or Virtu](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/#getting-an-account-without-haka-or-virtu), by contacting <servicedesk@csc.fi>

If you already have an account, you can visit:

<https://my.csc.fi/myProfile>

There you will be able to see and edit the account details, like change your password.

# Project access

.container[.col[

Once you have an account, you need access to a project. You can get access with two different roles:

* [Project manager](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/#project-manager)
* [Member](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/#member)

Once done, you can confirm access by login in <https://pouta.csc.fi> \[1\] .footnote[\[1\] You can login using **Haka** or a **CSC account**, but you still need to have an active CSC account]
