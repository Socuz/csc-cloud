"Is one such model for enabling convenient, **on-demand** network access to a **shared pool** of configurable computing resources. Resources like networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. They can be **rapidly** provisioned and released with **minimal management** effort or service provider interaction‚Äù[1].footnote[[1] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing>]

# Cloud computing characteristics

.container[.col[

* Cloud Computing has 5 essential characteristics
  * On-demand self-service
  * Broad network access
  * Resource pooling
  * Rapid elasticity
  * Measured Service

* The trend so far
  * Colocation: rented space in shared facility, user-configured, user-managed
  * Virtualization: user-configured, provider-managed
  * Containerization: automatically managed and configured infrastructure

* Infrastructure as a Service:

> "The network and hardware **infrastructure** is offered to you, the user, so you can just worry about running your Operating system of choice, the Software you need to run and nothing else".

  * No worries about: Hardware issues
  * Flexibility in scaling up and down
  * Control via API
  * Software defined network (**SDN**)

* Platform as a Service:

  > "The network and hardware infrastructure, plus the Operating System and thge middleware is offered as a **platform** to you, the user, so you can just worry about installing, configuring and using the Software and nothing else".

  * No worries about: Hardware issues, Operation systems patches, etc.
  * Security: Containers allow software from independent teams of people to run isolated, even though they run in the same hardware.
  * Control via API
  * QoS: Orchestration services provide assured resources

* Software as a Service

  > "Software is offered to you, the user, so you can just worry about using the Software and nothing else."

  * No worries, only use the software.
  * Examples:
     * myCSC
     * Web mail
     * Web Office platforms
