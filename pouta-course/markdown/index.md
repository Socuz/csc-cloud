## üôÇ

* The **Pouta Cloud** is CSC‚Äôs Infrastructure as a Service ([IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service)) offering. Based on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).
  * Allows running Virtual Machines (VMs) on CSC‚Äôs Data Center infrastructure. Grants users **full control** over the OS, middleware and run time environments. On the flip side, users are responsible **manage** and **secure** their VMs.
* Provides an IaaS cloud environment for your **sensitive data** processing (ePouta).

# Cloud computing characteristics

.container[.col[

* Cloud Computing has 5 essential characteristics
  * On-demand self-service
  * Broad network access
  * Resource pooling
  * Rapid elasticity
  * Measured Service

* The trend so far
  * Colocation: rented space in shared facility, user-configured, user-managed
  * Virtualization: user-configured, provider-managed
  * Containerization: automatically managed and configured infrastructure

# OpenStack software

.container[.col66[

* CSC‚Äôs cPouta/ePouta cloud services are powered by OpenStack.
  * Current OpenStack version used by Pouta services is Queens
* OpenStack is a cloud software that allows end user to create  and use their VM instances, networks and storage.
* Virtualization is a technology that allows the creation of virtual computer resources such as CPU, storage, network, etc.
* Fast moving open source project with backing from industrial giants like: AT&T, Red Hat, IBM, Intel, HP etc.
* Flexible architecture which may support different types of scales.
* Used by many organizations from research institutes to service/content providers.
* Large customer base augments better availability of expertise, support and chances of continuity.
* Supports Web UI, CLI and REST Interfaces

Click on create Key Pair, name key as
**lastname_firstname**

].col[

Download the *private* key and store it safely. It **will not** be possible to download the private key again.

The public key will be stored in Pouta.

It is also possible to create the key using the command line tool `ssh-keygen` and then upload the public key to Pouta.

#### Linux and Mac OS X

1. Create `.ssh` directory in `$HOME` if it is not there already, copy the key pair to the `.ssh` directory, and fix permissions.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p  .ssh
  chmod 700 .ssh
  mv ~/Downloads/yourkey.pem ~/.ssh/
  chmod 400 .ssh/yourkey.pem

1. Protect key with passphrase (Optional)

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -p -f yourkey.pem

#### Windows

1. Download Putty and Puttygen tools if you don‚Äôt have them
1. Load your private key (`yourkey.pem`) into puttygen and change it to .ppk format
1. Open Putty, load .ppk file under Connection | SSH | Auth | Private key file for authentication
    1. Provide user name cloud-user
    1. Provide the password which you added to Puttygen (Optional)

# [Pouta] Security groups

A Security Group defines a set of cloud level firewall rules for filtering traffic, typically inbound, but also outbound.

.container[.col70[

* By default a "Security Group" blocks all incoming connections to your VM,
  * and allows all outgoing connections.
* VM level firewall rules are still possible as an extra layer of security.
* One security group includes one or several several ‚Äúrules‚Äù.
* One security group can be assigned to one or several Virtual machines.
* One Virtual machine can be assigned one or several security groups.

# [Pouta] Creating a security group rules

.container[.col50[

* Navigate to:
  * **Network > Security Groups**
* First create a security group (any sensible "Name" and "Description" are valid).
* Secondly, click in "Manage Rules" and create rule opening entries.
  * You may use a predefined rule, ex. SSH, where you only need to provide the range of IPs that will be able to connect using SSH.
  * You may also create a "Custom TCP/UDP/ICMP Rule", where more fine grained rules can be defined.

# [Pouta] Creating an Instance

.container[.col[

* Navigate to:

* Give **Instance name** as `lastname_firstname_instance`.
* Select a **Flavor** of your choice (`standard.tiny` is a good first choice)
* Select **Instance Boot Source** as "Boot from image".
* Pick an **Image Name** - any image
* Navigate to the **Access & Security** tab and select your **Key Pair**.
  * Make sure that the ‚ÄúSSH - World‚Äù Security Group is selected (otherwise the firewall will block the connection).

# Persistent Data Volumes

.container[.col70[

A good practice is to separate the **data** from the **application** (OS and other software). Volumes are very helpful to achieve this. It is recommended to store the data in a volume, and the OS and software in another.

* Volumes are **project specific**, not user specific.
* A project can have **several volumes**.
* Volumes can be **transferred to other projects** in same cloud service.
* One volume can be **attached to one VM** at a time.
* Volumes can be management with **web interface** or **command line client**.
* Data stored in Persistent volumes is resilient to Disk Failures, Server failures, Accidental deletion of VMs, Crashing of VMs
  * But not to human errors ‚û°Ô∏è No Backups.
* It is easy to create and recover snapshots.

# What is Object Storage

.container[.col[

* Object storage is a¬†computer data storage¬†architecture that manages data as objects.
* Each object consists of three things: Data, Metadata and Globally unique identifier.
* Different from other data storage architectures like¬†File Storage: Data as a file hierarchy and¬†Block Storage: Data as blocks within sectors and tracks.
* Accessed via APIs at application-level, rather than via OS at system level.
* Scalable and Self healing storage.
