# Getting Access

## 1. Login in the web interface

This is a simple exercise. You _just_ need a CSC account with Pouta access, you can get it in two ways:

* You have been provided with a **training account** username and password.

* If not, follow the [How to create new user account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/). Once you got an account, you need the account to be member of a project with Pouta access, follow [Creating a new project](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/) and [Adding service access for a project](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).

Go to <https://pouta.csc.fi> and log in.
